# Nimble Take Home Assignment (React)
<p>
  <p>
    Thank you for your interest in Nimble! For this task, please implement a combination of React components to create a page with a list of candidates using the data found in src/data/candidates.json.
  </p>

  <p>
    Please host your code on Github and share the repo link via email to wgray@hirenimble.com and lauren@hirenimble.com.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

### Specification

1. When the user clicks a row in the list of candidates, it should expand a list of that candidate's applications. If the user clicks a row that is already expanded, it should close the list of that candidate's applications.
2. When the user clicks an application line item, bring up a modal/overlay that shows all of the candidate information and information specific to that application/role. Some modal code has been provided in src/ui-kit/Modal.jsx, but feel free to use your own if you'd like.
